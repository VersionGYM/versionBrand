### Brand Logo Concept Ideas
For the **Version logo**, you could consider the following ideas:
1. **Typography Style**:
   - **Gothic Font**: The word "Version" written in a bold Gothic font would give a strong, edgy vibe, reflecting the intensity of fitness.
   - The **rainbow arc** could represent diversity, progression, and energy. You could have the "Version" text arcing across a color spectrum in a subtle gradient, starting with one color on the left and fading to another on the right. This would symbolize **growth, balance, and transformation**—perfect for a fitness brand.
   
2. **Color Palette**:
   - The **rainbow** effect could feature more muted tones, like a washed-out pastel gradient for a more minimalist and modern feel, or you could go with vibrant, contrasting colors for a bold, energetic look.
   - Consider using **black** or **white** for the base of the text, with the rainbow arc above or below the text, making the logo dynamic without overwhelming the eye.

3. **Logo Layout**:
   - The text “Version” in Gothic, arched, with the rainbow form either surrounding or integrated above the text. You could have it “fading” in from left to right or a classic curve.
   - Alternatively, the logo could have a **bold, centered “V”** with the rest of the word in smaller, Gothic letters underneath, with the rainbow form wrapping around the "V" to add a sleek, modern feel.

**Example Concept**: 
- "VERSION" in a Gothic font with a **rainbow gradient arc** starting from the bottom left corner of the text and curving upwards, symbolizing strength, growth, and evolution.
